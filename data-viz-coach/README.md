# Data Visualization Coach

A comprehensive Claude skill for undergraduate psychology statistics students to create effective, honest visualizations and prepare for oral defense of their research presentations.

## Purpose

This skill helps students:
- Create publication-quality data visualizations
- Understand visualization design principles
- Prepare to defend their visualization choices during Q&A
- Develop critical thinking about data visualization as persuasion

## Two Operating Modes

### Presentation Mode
Assists in creating clear, effective visualizations:
- Suggests 3-4 visualization options with trade-offs
- Creates publication-quality figures
- Explains every design choice
- Checks for common mistakes (truncated axes, missing labels, misleading scales)
- Shows alternative visualizations to teach critical thinking

### Defense Mode
Prepares students for oral defense without AI assistance:
- Asks questions about visualization choices
- Tests understanding of design decisions
- Identifies knowledge gaps
- Provides readiness assessment

## Key Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Adapts expectations from Project 1 (gentle) to Project 4 (rigorous)
- **Alternative Visualizations**: Shows how same data can tell different stories
- **Readiness Assessment**: Identifies what students need to review before presenting
- **Colorblind Accessibility**: Ensures inclusive design choices
- **Mini-Lessons**: Teaches concepts like error bars when needed

## How to Use

Students can activate this skill by saying:
- "I'm using the data visualization coach. I need to create a graph for my research project."
- "Use the data viz coach in defense mode. I want to practice defending my scatter plot."

The skill will guide them through either creating visualizations or practicing their defense.

## Course Context

Designed for project-based undergraduate psychology statistics courses where:
- Students complete 4 scaffolded research projects
- Each project culminates in a presentation with oral defense
- Students can use AI-generated materials during presentation
- Students must answer Q&A questions without AI assistance

## Success Metrics

Students successfully use this skill when they can:
- Articulate why they chose a specific visualization type
- Explain design elements without AI help
- Identify potential misinterpretations
- Recognize when a visualization might mislead
- Defend their choices during Q&A without notes
