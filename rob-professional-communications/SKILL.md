# Rob's Professional Communications Style

When drafting emails, letters, memos, or internal communications for Rob, follow these style guidelines to maintain his voice and approach.

## Scope of This Skill

**This skill applies to:**
- Emails (internal and external)
- Letters (formal and semi-formal)
- Internal memos and communications
- Brief reports or summaries for colleagues
- Informal updates and announcements

**This skill does NOT apply to:**
- Formal reports requiring institutional voice
- Academic papers or scholarly writing
- External publications or marketing materials
- Grant proposals or highly technical documents

## Core Tone & Philosophy

- **Warm but professional** - collegial and conversational, never overly formal or corporate
- **Encouraging without inflation** - supportive but grounded, avoiding saccharine praise
- **Respectful of autonomy** - frames suggestions rather than directives
- **Thoughtful peer voice** - sounds like an observant colleague in higher education, not a supervisor or bureaucrat

## General Structure

### Opening
- Acknowledge prior communication, effort, or relevant context
- Often opens with thanks or recognition
- Use clear, natural transitions from greeting to purpose

### Body (2-3 short paragraphs maximum)
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness
- Use bullet points when they clarify steps, decisions, or responses
- Avoid repetition and long-winded explanations
- Frame feedback using "what works well..." and "what could be strengthened..." language
- Organize with focus—respect the reader's time and attention

### Closing
- Include invitation to follow up or collaborate further when appropriate
- Use friendly but not overly casual sign-off
- **Standard closing: "Take care, Rob"**
- For formal letters where greater formality is needed: "Sincerely, Rob" or "Best regards, Rob"

## Language Conventions

### Always Avoid
- **Never use em dashes (—) for any reason**
- Corporate jargon and buzzwords
- The word "team" 
- Excessive enthusiasm or inflated language
- Declarative prescriptiveness unless clarity demands it

### Prefer
- Conditional phrasing: "I might suggest...", "I'd encourage...", "You might consider...", "A possible next step could be..."
- Balanced phrasing with parallel structure or rhythm
- Self-referential framing for gentler suggestions
- Fairness, clarity, and context over strict directives
- Polished but grounded language

## Format-Specific Guidance

### Letters
- Include date at top when appropriate
- Use recipient's full name and title in address block for formal letters
- Maintain the same warm, collegial tone unless context demands greater formality
- For formal letters (external, official capacity): use "Sincerely" or "Best regards"
- For semi-formal letters (colleagues, known contacts): use "Take care"
- Keep letters concise—even formal letters benefit from brevity and focus

### Internal Memos
- Use clear subject lines that indicate purpose
- State purpose in opening sentence
- Use bullet points liberally to organize information
- Can be more direct than emails when needed, but maintain respectful tone
- "Take care, Rob" works well for most internal memos

### Adjusting Formality
Rob's style maintains warmth and approachability even in more formal contexts. When greater formality is needed:
- Maintain respectful, collegial tone but reduce conversational elements
- Keep conditional phrasing ("I'd suggest") but you can be slightly more direct
- Use complete sentences rather than fragments
- Still avoid corporate jargon and em dashes
- Remain concise and focused—formality doesn't mean verbosity

## Examples

### Example 1: Feedback Email

**Bad approach:**
> Hi Sarah—
> 
> Thanks for sending this over! The team really appreciates your hard work on this project. There are a few things we need to address before moving forward.
> 
> First, the introduction needs work. Second, the methodology section is unclear. Finally, we need better citations.
> 
> Let me know if you have questions!
> Best, Rob

**Good approach:**
> Hi Sarah,
> 
> Thank you for sharing this draft. I can see the thoughtful attention you've given to framing the research questions.
> 
> As you revise, I'd suggest focusing on two areas. What works well is the clarity of your research design; what could be strengthened is the connection between your literature review and the methodology you've chosen. You might consider adding a brief transition paragraph that makes those links more explicit. I'd also encourage a closer review of citation formatting in the appendix.
> 
> I'm happy to discuss these suggestions further if that would be helpful.
> 
> Take care, Rob

### Example 2: Brief Response

**Bad approach:**
> Hi Marcus—
> 
> Got your email. Yes, let's meet Thursday at 2pm. I'll send a calendar invite. See you then!
> 
> Rob

**Good approach:**
> Hi Marcus,
> 
> Thursday at 2pm works well. I'll send a calendar invite shortly, and I'm looking forward to discussing the assessment project with you.
> 
> Take care, Rob

### Example 3: Semi-Formal Letter

**Context:** Letter to a campus colleague about a collaborative opportunity

> October 28, 2025
> 
> Dear Dr. Patel,
> 
> Thank you for your thoughtful proposal to collaborate on the teaching and learning initiative this spring. I appreciate the careful attention you've given to aligning our departments' goals.
> 
> I'd like to suggest we focus our initial efforts on the faculty development workshops you outlined in section two. This approach would allow us to build momentum while keeping scope manageable. You might consider reaching out to the Center for Teaching Excellence as potential partners—they've expressed interest in similar work.
> 
> I'm happy to discuss this further at your convenience. Would early November work for an initial planning conversation?
> 
> Take care,
> Rob

### Example 4: Internal Memo

**Context:** Update to department colleagues about assessment process

> **To:** Psychology Department Faculty
> **From:** Rob
> **Date:** October 28, 2025
> **Re:** Spring Assessment Timeline
> 
> I wanted to share a brief update on our spring assessment work and clarify the timeline for the coming months.
> 
> Key dates to note:
> - November 15: Draft learning outcomes due to assessment committee
> - December 10: Feedback returned to faculty
> - January 20: Revised outcomes finalized
> 
> I'd encourage you to review the rubric template I shared last month as you draft your outcomes. If you'd like feedback on drafts before the November deadline, I'm happy to take a look.
> 
> Please reach out if you have questions or if the timeline presents challenges.
> 
> Take care, Rob
